* Goal / Tasks
  - WE NEED TO START ORDERING SHIT
  - ALWAYS GO TO OFFICE HOURS
* Mathematical Derivation
  - Size of the current quadcopter
  - Start having some shit on paper so we can ask more solid question during office hours
* Project plan

** Model  
   1) Describe the motion
      - assign a coordination system
   2) Apply physical law / draw free body diagram
      - F = ma
      - To draw a free body diagram
	+ draw forces in direction they act
	+ assume x and x' is positive values
	+ deduce signs from direction of arrow
