* Goal / Tasks
  - WE NEED TO START ORDERING SHIT
  - ALWAYS GO TO OFFICE HOURS
* Mathematical Derivation
  - Size of the current quadcopter
  - Start having some shit on paper so we can ask more solid question during office hours
** Free Body Diagram
** Inertial Frame vs Body Frame
* Project plan

* Research Online
** Model  
   1) Describe the motion
      - assign a coordination system
   2) Apply physical law / draw free body diagram
      - F = ma
      - To draw a free body diagram
	+ draw forces in direction they act
	+ assume x and x' is positive values
	+ deduce signs from direction of arrow
	
   3) 
* Final Presentation and report tips advices from Professor Mehta:
1) Emphasize connection among all four different areas we worked on:
	- Mathematical Modeling
	- Simulation
	- Motor analysis
	- Physical Implementation
2) Have a cohisive story in order to tie all separtate parts back into the same project:
- Wilson and Lin can use similar diagrams  
- Lin can use the same colors as in physical prototype
- Lin exlapins the equation he had for optimal speed(how was the derivation) 
3) Prepare an effective demo
